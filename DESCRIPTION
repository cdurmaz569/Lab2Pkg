Description: This package analyzes data from the Centers for Medicare & 
    Medicaid Services. The data include hospital-specific charges for more than 
    3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment 
    System (IPPS) payments for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011. 
    This package has two functions: plot_payments and get_medicare_stats. The
    plot_payments function outputs a boxplot of average payments for a 
    specified payment type for each DRG. The get_medicare_stats function outputs
    a calculated statistic (mean, median, or sd) over all DRG codes for average
    Medicare payments.
